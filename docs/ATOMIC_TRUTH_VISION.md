# Sentinel: Atomic Truth & Onnisciente Coding

## Vision Statement
To evolve Sentinel from a cognitive operating system into the world's first **Deterministic Atomic Coding Engine**. Sentinel will not just assist in writing code; it will guarantee the functional and architectural integrity of every single code change through mathematical decomposition and cryptographic verification.

## Core Concepts

### 1. The Atomic Task (The Atom)
An "Atom" is the smallest verifiable unit of change. 
- **Input/Output Contract:** Strictly defined types and interfaces.
- **Invariants:** Rules that must never be broken (e.g., "this function must never return null").
- **Proof of Correctness:** A combination of passing tests, 100% alignment score, and syntactic perfection.

### 2. Deterministic Decomposition (The Slicer)
High-level goals are automatically broken down into a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of Atoms. 
- Sentinel understands that Atom B depends on Atom A.
- It prevents the agent from working on B until A is "Signed and Sealed".

### 3. The Onnisciente Context (The Weaver)
Sentinel maintains a 10-layer real-time map of the entire project. 
- When an Atom is forged, Sentinel knows exactly how it ripples through the rest of the system.
- Global consistency is maintained via Layer 2 (Alignment Field) and Layer 10 (Swarm Consensus).

## Implementation Roadmap (Phase 4)

### Phase 4.1: Atomic Specification Engine
- **Goal:** Transform natural language intent into machine-readable Atomic Contracts.
- **Success Metric:** 100% of tasks have defined I/O contracts before coding begins.

### Phase 4.2: Isolated Forge (Sandboxing)
- **Goal:** Every code change is generated and tested in a virtualized environment.
- **Success Metric:** Zero broken builds in the main branch.

### Phase 4.3: Cross-Project Intelligence (P2P Truth)
- **Goal:** Share verified atomic patterns across the Sentinel Network.
- **Success Metric:** >30% reduction in generation time via pattern reuse.
